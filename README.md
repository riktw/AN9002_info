Info and a logging script for the AN9002 multimeter

This has just been tested on 1 multimeter. You might need to change the address in the python scripts.

## usage
Run the script. After a few seconds it should connect and start showing a graph.
Pressing "q" inside the terminal stops the script and stores the data into a csv file. 
If the unit of measurement is changed(going from volt to amp for example), the logging starts again.
